# Unittests in JS

Welcome to the Unit Testing in JavaScript with Jest project! In this guide, we'll explore the process of writing and running unit tests for your JavaScript code using the popular testing framework, Jest. Unit testing is a crucial practice in software development to ensure that individual components of your code function correctly in isolation.

## Introduction to Unit Testing

Unit testing involves testing individual units or components of your code in isolation. This practice ensures that each unit functions correctly as expected. In JavaScript, unit testing frameworks like Jest provide tools to write, run, and manage tests effectively.

## Getting Started

To get started with unit testing in JavaScript using Jest, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js and npm on your machine if not already installed.
2. Create a new project directory and navigate to it using the command line.
3. Run `npm init` to initialize a new Node.js project and create a `package.json` file.
4. Install Jest as a development dependency by running `npm install --save-dev jest`.

## Writing Test Cases

Write test cases for your functions or modules by creating `.test.js` files alongside your source files. A test case typically includes input data, the function being tested, and expected output. Here's a simple example:

```javascript
// capitalize.js
function capitalize(str) {
  return str.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
}

module.exports = capitalize;
