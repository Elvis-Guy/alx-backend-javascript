# 0x03. ES6 Data Manipulation Project

## Overview

Welcome to the 0x03. ES6 Data Manipulation project! In this project, you will learn about various ES6 data manipulation techniques, focusing on arrays and different data structures like Set, Map, and WeakMap. You will also get hands-on experience with higher-order array functions such as `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will achieve the following learning objectives:

1. **Array Manipulation**: Understand how to effectively use `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` on arrays to transform data, filter elements, and reduce arrays to single values.

2. **Typed Arrays**: Gain knowledge about typed arrays and their usage. You will be able to perform low-level manipulations on binary data using various typed array types.

3. **Set Data Structure**: Explore the Set data structure provided by ES6. Learn how to store unique values and perform set-related operations like union, intersection, and difference.

4. **Map Data Structure**: Learn about the Map data structure in ES6, which allows you to store key-value pairs and efficiently access values based on their keys.

5. **WeakMap**: Understand the concept of WeakMap, a specialized Map that allows for weak references to keys. You will explore its use cases and benefits in certain scenarios.

## Resources

Before diving into the project, make sure to go through the following resources:

- [Typed Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays)
- [Set Data Structure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set)

## Project Structure

The project contains the following files and directories:

- `index.js`: This file contains the main code for the data manipulation tasks. You will be working in this file to implement the required functions.
- `test.js`: Unit tests for the functions you implement in `index.js`. You can run these tests to check if your code is functioning correctly.
- `data.js`: Sample data arrays and other data structures used in the tests.
- `utils.js`: Utility functions (if required) for the project.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory using your terminal or command prompt.
3. Install any dependencies by running: `npm install` or `yarn install` (if there are any).
4. Open the `index.js` file using your preferred code editor.
5. Implement the required functions following the instructions and hints provided in the comments.
6. Run the tests using: `npm test` or `yarn test` and verify if your code passes all the test cases.
7. If any test case fails, review your implementation and fix the issues accordingly.
8. Repeat steps 5-7 until all test cases pass.
